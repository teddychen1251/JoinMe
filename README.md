# JoinMe

An app that simplifies being social with just a click of a button! 

Let's say you were going to the gym and wanted some friends to come with. Instead of going through the hassle of texting them, setting a time, and dealing with cancellations, you could make an event that would appear on your friends' feed. It would tell them what you were doing, where you're going, and when. They could click "Join" on the app if they wanted to come along, and the app would let you know. This way, you're not bogged down with logistics and your friends can hang out with you!

Made in Xcode with Swift, SnapKit(SnapChat's APIs), and Google Cloud Firestore
